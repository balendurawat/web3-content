Day4:

Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)

-A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a type of cryptographic proof that provides users with a higher degree of privacy when engaging in digital transactions. 
-In essence, ZKPs enable one party to prove to another party that they know a specific value, without conveying any other information apart from the fact that they know that value. 
-In short, these proofs allow for information to be accurately verified without sharing any details about the underlying information and the identities of the transaction participants.



Day5:

Zero-Knowledge Rollup (zk-Rollup)

-A Zero-Knowledge Rollup (zk-Rollup) — also known as a Zero-Knowledge Proof Rollup or ZKR — is a Layer-2 scaling solution that uses zk-SNARKs (privacy-based cryptographic proofs) to allow blockchains to bundle transactions into one computation prior to execution by using a smart contract. 
-This secure scaling solution increases transactional throughput while also enhancing protocol privacy. StarkWare, Loopring, Hermez, and Aztec are blockchain networks that use zk-Rollups. 
-Sometimes used in unison with decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols, implementing zk-Rollups on some blockchains can lead to lower transaction fees, improved liquidity, enhanced non-custodial crypto ownership, and more.

-zk-SNARKS became prominent with Zcash, Monero, and other privacy-based blockchain protocols.


Day8:


Byzantine Fault Tolerance Delegated Proof of Stake (BFT-DPoS)


-Byzantine Fault Tolerance Delegated Proof of Stake (BFT-DPoS) is the primary consensus mechanism that runs the EOSIO and ICON blockchain ecosystems. 
-BFT-DPoS is a highly-performant consensus mechanism that makes use of data passing between parties without an intermediary. 
-It is composed of the two main layers that work together: Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) to propagate and validate block production, and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) for block producer voting and scheduling.


Day9:

Byzantine Generals' Problem

-The Byzantine Generals' Problem is a term used in computing to describe a situation in which all parties or components within a system must agree on a single consensus-based strategy in order to avoid complete network failure. -Failure can be caused when one of the nodes or other architectural components within the network are unreliable. 
-A network that is able to solve the Byzantine Generals’ Problem is considered Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT). 
-Most actively used blockchain consensus mechanisms are Byzantine Fault Tolerant.



Day10:

Hashing

-Hashing is the process of taking an input of any size and using a mathematical function called a hash function to create an output of fixed size. Hash functions are considered one-way functions. 
-Unlike encryption, which is intended to conceal data as it moves over a network or is stored on a device, hashing is primarily used to verify the authenticity of data. 
-Hashing also serves an important security function in protecting network components such as passwords and sensitive information that can be stored as hashes — the outputs of hash functions.



Day11:

Hash Function

-Hash functions are algorithms that take data of any size and convert it into a fixed-length hexadecimal number, or hash. 
-Hash functions are one-way functions and cannot be reversed to reveal the data inputted to create the hash. 
-The Bitcoin blockchain utilizes the SHA-256 hash algorithm in its transaction validation process.


Day12:

Day21:


Peg (Stablecoin)  (special hastags : #trading, #cryptotrading, #stablecoin)
-A peg is a predetermined price used to establish the exchange rate between two assets. 
-Normally, most assets fluctuate with market forces, but stablecoins are pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar to maintain price stability and to safeguard investors against market volatility. 
-Generally, stablecoins are given a hard peg or a soft peg. 
-Different stablecoin types maintain their peg by different mechanisms. 
-These include backing the stablecoin 1:1 with fiat currency reserves, crypto-collateralized stablecoins, supply-modifying stablecoins, and other peg-maintaining designs.



Day22:


Roll-Up
-Roll-ups are an off-chain aggregation of transactions inside a smart contract. 
-Roll-ups are used to combine and process smart contract transactions off-chain before settling the final state on-chain. 
-This is done to lower transaction fees given that the rising popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) offerings has caused fees to increase substantially on some blockchain protocols. 
-Roll-ups are considered a throughput solution, not a scaling solution, as they usually require additional hardware to settle transactions on-chain.





Day23:


Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS) (Elrond Network)
-Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS) is Elrond Network’s enhanced version of Proof of Stake (PoS). 
-It enables advanced security and distributed fairness while eliminating computational waste that Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems typically struggle with. 
-The SPoS consensus system achieves high security through a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)-like consensus methodology that utilizes instantaneous randomized validator selection through the reshuffling of nodes into other shards. 
-To accomplish this, SPoS makes use of Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS) multi-signature technology to randomly select nodes within each shard to achieve validator selection finalization in 100 milliseconds, or 0.1 seconds.









Day24:


Security Token Offering (STO)
-Security Token Offerings (STOs) are a method of distributing security tokens and exist somewhere between Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). 
-To better understand this, it's important to note that security tokens are equity tokens that represent an equity stake in a company or asset, in addition to whatever future returns are associated with partial ownership of that entity, such as dividend payouts. 
-STOs are generally considered superior to ICOs due to the fact that STOs offer instant settlement times, clearer regulatory guidelines, higher liquidity, and a lower barrier to entry in many instances, among other benefits. 
-Since enterprises that create registered securities must adhere to specific compliance and regulatory requirements, STOs avoid a lot of the market ambiguity which ultimately turned many investors off to ICOs, while continuing to offer a straightforward, investor-friendly method of issuing, trading, and storing tokenized equity shares.



Day25:


Segregated Witness (SegWit)
-Segregated Witness (SegWit) is the name of a soft fork that was carried out on the Bitcoin network which changed the transaction format of the protocol. 
-Segwit separates signature data from transaction data within the blockchain to increase the total amount of data within a specific block. 
-By rearranging the data contained in each block more efficiently, more space is freed up which allows for the inclusion of additional data. 
-SegWit is capable of increasing Bitcoin's block size limit from 1MB to 2MB and was designed to mitigate the blockchain size limitation issues that periodically slow down transaction speeds on the Bitcoin network. 
-This is accomplished by "segregating" the transaction into two segments by removing the unlocking signature's "witness" data from the original portion and appending it as a separate structure at the end of the block.





Day 26:



SHA-256
-SHA-256 is a member of the SHA-2 cryptographic hash function family that was designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and later made famous for being a foundational aspect of the Bitcoin blockchain network. 
-SHA-256 is a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) that secures data by utilizing a cryptographic mathematical operation to generate a unique 256-bit, 64-character random sequence of letters and numbers (called a hash) out of an input. 
-These functions are generally designed to serve as a one-way function that is virtually impossible to reverse once a piece of underlying data has been amended into its hash value.



Day 27:


Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) Cryptography
-Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) cryptography is a specialized cryptographic algorithm that was initially proposed in 1979 by Isreali cryptographer Adi Shamir. 
-Shamir Secret Sharing is designed to secure data through encryption. 
-It accomplishes this by sharing private “secrets” within a distributed computing network. 
-This process allows data to be separated into many shares, yet it only requires a small portion of the shares to reconstruct the original secret. 
-Because of its structure, Shamir’s algorithm is extremely adaptable and extensible, and provides the framework that allows secret owners to modify or remove shares without modifying the original secret.


Day 28:

Sidechain (Side Chain)
-A sidechain (or side chain) is an external secondary blockchain protocol that is connected to a primary blockchain network (mainchain). 
-Sidechains are typically designed to allow for the transfer of data and value between themselves and the mainchain, and oftentimes use a different consensus mechanism than the mainchain. 
-As a result, sidechains can allow for a higher degree of flexibility and scalability, given that systems with a significant sidechain interoperability component are often designed to cater to a broader range of enterprise and individual users. 
-For example, some sidechain solutions allow for the transfer of assets back and forth between multiple protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin. 
-Other examples of sidechain capabilities include enhancements used for Layer-2 scaling solutions to increase the transaction speeds of the mainchain



Day 29:


Signature (Cryptographic)
-A cryptographic signature is a mathematical mechanism that is used to verify the authenticity of a digital message or digital document within a digital network. 
-Cryptographic signatures are commonly used for financial transactions, digital contract management, software distribution, and a broad array of other use cases that prioritize the accurate detection and prevention of forgery and data-tampering. 
-In regards to blockchain technology, cryptographic signatures are typically used to prove that the correct private key was used to initiate and send a transaction through a complex authentication process that involves the use of both a private and public key.

Day 35:

Token Migration
A token migration is the process of moving a cryptocurrency’s coins or tokens from one blockchain to another. This often happens when a project transitions from using a third-party blockchain (such as Ethereum) to operating their own proprietary blockchain. Token migrations can also happen for other reasons, such as migrating from one chain to another to save on transaction costs.


Day 36:

Tokenomics
-Tokenomics, a portmanteau of “token” and “economics,” refers to the underlying attributes of a cryptocurrency token that incentivize users to adopt the token’s project ecosystem. 
-Among cryptocurrency investors, the term is commonly referred to in terms of how the token is utilized within the project ecosystem, or how the token will follow a monetary policy as the project develops. -Therefore, the term tokenomics encapsulates a variety of processes and concepts, some of which are hard-coded into a blockchain's protocol, and others which are more speculative in nature.






Day 37:


Verifiable Delay Function (VDF)
-A verifiable delay function (VDF) is a cryptographic primitive created in 2018, built to run a given number of sequential steps which allows the end result to be efficiently verified. 
-VDFs can be implemented within the context of blockchain and computer systems to help create trustless, public randomness in network-based environments.
