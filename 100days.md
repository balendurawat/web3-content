Day1:

Application Binary Interface (ABI)

-An application binary interface (ABI) is a standardized method for engaging with smart contracts in a blockchain ecosystem. 
-ABIs allow smart contracts to engage with external data, as well as with other contracts internal to the blockchain platform. 
-ABIs are similar to application programming interfaces (APIs) in that they enable separate software systems to communicate and interact with each other.



Day2:

Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI)

-The Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI) is a specialized application programming interface (API) built by Tendermint, the company that created the Cosmos blockchain. 
-The ABCI is designed to operate as a middle layer that allows blockchain-based replication engines present on several computers and a deterministic state machine (the application) present on a single computer to communicate. 
-In simpler terms, the ABCI allows a blockchain protocol to communicate with an application to enable application development and other related purposes.




Day3:

BABE Consensus Mechanism (#polkadot

-The Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) is one of the two central components of the hybrid consensus mechanism that Polkadot utilizes to secure and maintain its network. 
-BABE is a mechanism for producing blocks, while its counterpart, GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement (GRANDPA), is a mechanism for finalizing the state of the blockchain.


Day4:

Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)

-A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a type of cryptographic proof that provides users with a higher degree of privacy when engaging in digital transactions. 
-In essence, ZKPs enable one party to prove to another party that they know a specific value, without conveying any other information apart from the fact that they know that value. 
-In short, these proofs allow for information to be accurately verified without sharing any details about the underlying information and the identities of the transaction participants.



Day5:

Zero-Knowledge Rollup (zk-Rollup)

-A Zero-Knowledge Rollup (zk-Rollup) — also known as a Zero-Knowledge Proof Rollup or ZKR — is a Layer-2 scaling solution that uses zk-SNARKs (privacy-based cryptographic proofs) to allow blockchains to bundle transactions into one computation prior to execution by using a smart contract. 
-This secure scaling solution increases transactional throughput while also enhancing protocol privacy. StarkWare, Loopring, Hermez, and Aztec are blockchain networks that use zk-Rollups. 
-Sometimes used in unison with decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols, implementing zk-Rollups on some blockchains can lead to lower transaction fees, improved liquidity, enhanced non-custodial crypto ownership, and more.



Day6:

Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (zk-STARK)

-A zero-knowledge scalable transparent argument of knowledge (zk-STARK) is a specialized type of cryptographic proof that is used to ensure privacy on blockchain-based distributed ledger systems. 
-It works by proving that one party is in possession of specific data without actually revealing the data to the network. 
-Zk-STARKs are a crucial element of Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups), a popular Layer-2 scaling solution. 
-Zk-STARKs are a new development based on zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKS), and are distinguished by being more trustless than their predecessor.



Day7:
zk-SNARK

-A Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) is a type of cryptographic proof used to ensure privacy on blockchain-based distributed ledger systems. 
-It works by proving that one party is in possession of specific data without actually revealing the data to the network by using a secret key before the transaction is broadcasted. 
-zk-SNARKS became prominent with Zcash, Monero, and other privacy-based blockchain protocols.


Day8:


Byzantine Fault Tolerance Delegated Proof of Stake (BFT-DPoS)


-Byzantine Fault Tolerance Delegated Proof of Stake (BFT-DPoS) is the primary consensus mechanism that runs the EOSIO and ICON blockchain ecosystems. 
-BFT-DPoS is a highly-performant consensus mechanism that makes use of data passing between parties without an intermediary. 
-It is composed of the two main layers that work together: Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) to propagate and validate block production, and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) for block producer voting and scheduling.


Day9:

Byzantine Generals' Problem

-The Byzantine Generals' Problem is a term used in computing to describe a situation in which all parties or components within a system must agree on a single consensus-based strategy in order to avoid complete network failure. -Failure can be caused when one of the nodes or other architectural components within the network are unreliable. 
-A network that is able to solve the Byzantine Generals’ Problem is considered Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT). 
-Most actively used blockchain consensus mechanisms are Byzantine Fault Tolerant.



Day10:

Hashing

-Hashing is the process of taking an input of any size and using a mathematical function called a hash function to create an output of fixed size. Hash functions are considered one-way functions. 
-Unlike encryption, which is intended to conceal data as it moves over a network or is stored on a device, hashing is primarily used to verify the authenticity of data. 
-Hashing also serves an important security function in protecting network components such as passwords and sensitive information that can be stored as hashes — the outputs of hash functions.



Day11:

Hash Function

-Hash functions are algorithms that take data of any size and convert it into a fixed-length hexadecimal number, or hash. 
-Hash functions are one-way functions and cannot be reversed to reveal the data inputted to create the hash. 
-The Bitcoin blockchain utilizes the SHA-256 hash algorithm in its transaction validation process.


Day12:

Hash Rate

-The hash rate is the unit of measure for the computing power of a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. 
-The hash rate is valued in terahashes per second (TH/s), and increases or decreases according to the number of miners operating on the network.


Day13:


Illuvium Configuration Change Proposal (ICCP)

-Illuvium Configuration Change Proposals (ICCPs) are a mechanism used by the Illuvium blockchain gaming platform that allow for proposed changes to Illuvium’s System Configuration Variables. 
-ICCPs are documents that are used to propose changes to configurations within the Illuvium platform and its underlying architecture and are usually composed of potential amendments to marketplace fees, balance changes, configurable council values, and capture mechanics within the Illuvium protocol. 
-The authors of individual ICCPs are responsible for building consensus within the community and analyzing various community opinions in relation to the proposal.


Day14:

Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)

-The Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) facilitates the exchange of data between cryptographic key management servers and clients. 
-It plays a key connective role in the function of crypto wallets and other decentralized products. 
-KMIP was established by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), a nonprofit consortium focused on the development and adoption of open, global information-sharing standards.



Day15:

LAND (The Sandbox)

-In The Sandbox game, LAND is a digital piece of real estate in the metaverse measuring 96x96 meters. 
-LAND is an ERC-721 token. When a player combines multiple LANDS into one property, it is called an Estate.
