Day1:

Application Binary Interface (ABI)

-An application binary interface (ABI) is a standardized method for engaging with smart contracts in a blockchain ecosystem. 
-ABIs allow smart contracts to engage with external data, as well as with other contracts internal to the blockchain platform. 
-ABIs are similar to application programming interfaces (APIs) in that they enable separate software systems to communicate and interact with each other.



Day2:

Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI)

-The Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI) is a specialized application programming interface (API) built by Tendermint, the company that created the Cosmos blockchain. 
-The ABCI is designed to operate as a middle layer that allows blockchain-based replication engines present on several computers and a deterministic state machine (the application) present on a single computer to communicate. 
-In simpler terms, the ABCI allows a blockchain protocol to communicate with an application to enable application development and other related purposes.




Day3:

BABE Consensus Mechanism (#polkadot

-The Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) is one of the two central components of the hybrid consensus mechanism that Polkadot utilizes to secure and maintain its network. 
-BABE is a mechanism for producing blocks, while its counterpart, GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement (GRANDPA), is a mechanism for finalizing the state of the blockchain.


Day4:

Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)

-A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a type of cryptographic proof that provides users with a higher degree of privacy when engaging in digital transactions. 
-In essence, ZKPs enable one party to prove to another party that they know a specific value, without conveying any other information apart from the fact that they know that value. 
-In short, these proofs allow for information to be accurately verified without sharing any details about the underlying information and the identities of the transaction participants.



Day5:

Zero-Knowledge Rollup (zk-Rollup)

-A Zero-Knowledge Rollup (zk-Rollup) — also known as a Zero-Knowledge Proof Rollup or ZKR — is a Layer-2 scaling solution that uses zk-SNARKs (privacy-based cryptographic proofs) to allow blockchains to bundle transactions into one computation prior to execution by using a smart contract. 
-This secure scaling solution increases transactional throughput while also enhancing protocol privacy. StarkWare, Loopring, Hermez, and Aztec are blockchain networks that use zk-Rollups. 
-Sometimes used in unison with decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols, implementing zk-Rollups on some blockchains can lead to lower transaction fees, improved liquidity, enhanced non-custodial crypto ownership, and more.



Day6:

Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (zk-STARK)

-A zero-knowledge scalable transparent argument of knowledge (zk-STARK) is a specialized type of cryptographic proof that is used to ensure privacy on blockchain-based distributed ledger systems. 
-It works by proving that one party is in possession of specific data without actually revealing the data to the network. 
-Zk-STARKs are a crucial element of Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups), a popular Layer-2 scaling solution. 
-Zk-STARKs are a new development based on zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKS), and are distinguished by being more trustless than their predecessor.



Day7:
zk-SNARK

-A Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) is a type of cryptographic proof used to ensure privacy on blockchain-based distributed ledger systems. 
-It works by proving that one party is in possession of specific data without actually revealing the data to the network by using a secret key before the transaction is broadcasted. 
-zk-SNARKS became prominent with Zcash, Monero, and other privacy-based blockchain protocols.


Day8:


Byzantine Fault Tolerance Delegated Proof of Stake (BFT-DPoS)


-Byzantine Fault Tolerance Delegated Proof of Stake (BFT-DPoS) is the primary consensus mechanism that runs the EOSIO and ICON blockchain ecosystems. 
-BFT-DPoS is a highly-performant consensus mechanism that makes use of data passing between parties without an intermediary. 
-It is composed of the two main layers that work together: Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) to propagate and validate block production, and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) for block producer voting and scheduling.


Day9:

Byzantine Generals' Problem

-The Byzantine Generals' Problem is a term used in computing to describe a situation in which all parties or components within a system must agree on a single consensus-based strategy in order to avoid complete network failure. -Failure can be caused when one of the nodes or other architectural components within the network are unreliable. 
-A network that is able to solve the Byzantine Generals’ Problem is considered Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT). 
-Most actively used blockchain consensus mechanisms are Byzantine Fault Tolerant.



Day10:

Hashing

-Hashing is the process of taking an input of any size and using a mathematical function called a hash function to create an output of fixed size. Hash functions are considered one-way functions. 
-Unlike encryption, which is intended to conceal data as it moves over a network or is stored on a device, hashing is primarily used to verify the authenticity of data. 
-Hashing also serves an important security function in protecting network components such as passwords and sensitive information that can be stored as hashes — the outputs of hash functions.
